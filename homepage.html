            diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of  fingers or toes. These symptoms are 
            usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.</p>
            
            <p>Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment.

            so the patient can be directed to the right clinic.</p>
