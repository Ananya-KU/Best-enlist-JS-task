<h2>AWS CLOUD</h2><br>
<p><b>As a Select Tier Amazon Web Services Consulting Partner, we have worked with Fortune 500 and startup level clients to confirm architecture and technology choices, assess concepts, and deliver data migrations from a multitude of pre-existing environments.

<h2>MANAGED SERVICES</h2>
<p><b>If you make the transformative decision to migrate to the AWS Cloud, don’t forget that it’ll come with some maintenance afterwards. That means you and your staff will be spending time gaining AWS skills to ensure proper usage of our AWS environment, which can be tough. Cloud infrastructure is complex and requires plenty of specialized knowledge which can take a lot of time and effort to learn, so why not leave the work in the hands of experts?</b></p>
<p><b>That’s why we offer AWS Managed Services to consistently manage your AWS environment on your behalf, further increasing agility and opportunity for innovation. Our expertise will help you optimize your costs, meeting compliance requirements, accelerate migrations, and reduce risk without under-provisioning resources, lowering resilience, or slowing you down. To modernize and cut down on time, we’ll automate common activities such as change requests, patch management, and backup services.</b></p>
